# Classification of buyers
In this project I am going to show one classification method, using a basic deep learning model, to define if a possible purchaser either buy or not. For this I used a data set from Kaggle to extract all the possible features used by the model and try to make the best prediction, without go to over fitting.\\
This model works well and give me an accuracy of \textbf{90 \%} and to see with more detail I am going to show the confusion matrix of the model.
